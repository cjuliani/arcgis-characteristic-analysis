# [Characteristic analysis for mineral prospectivity mapping in ArcGIS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136817300756) (Ore Geology Reviews, Elsevier-2018)

The demo implements the multivariate method Characteristic Analysis for spatial data analysis in ArcGIS. The method was initially developed for mineral prospectivity mapping by McCammon et al., 1983, and applied for seabed mineral exploration by Juliani and Ellefmo, 2018.
