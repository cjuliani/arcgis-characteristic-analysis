# Characteristic analysis for mineral prospectivity mapping in ArcGIS

These scripts were developed to implement the multivariate method Characteristic Analysis in ArcGIS. The method was developed for mineral prospectivity mapping by McCammon et al., 1983, and applied for seabed mineral exploration by Juliani and Ellefmo, 2018.
